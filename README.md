# vanilla-js-projects

This is a repo dump with simple and small projects I made in order to learn vanilla JS front-end development. Each single project is separeted in a numbered folder that represents the order I conclude it.

The projects here included are very brief (in orther to learn a single topic, or so on...), so they aren't well described or documented as any other more serious project of mine.
